# Guideline

Status: approved

## Reader and promised transformation

The reader finished Article 2 with the interview-canvas application running
locally. Article 3 takes that exact app to a repeatable production-shaped setup:
tested across its real seams, packaged once, backed by Postgres, deployed through
infrastructure as code, and shipped through CI/CD. [HUMAN]

## Thesis and non-goals

The central claim is that AI-assisted deployment should use the same incremental
method as AI-assisted development: ask for one bounded artifact, run it, inspect
the failure, and only then add the next layer.
[INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end,full-stack-workshop-deployment]

This is not a generic cloud comparison, a complete AWS reference, or a claim
that generated deployment files are trustworthy without verification. It should
not return to the workshop's Snake Royale example. [HUMAN]

## Narrative order

1. Open as the third article in the series and recap the Article 2 handoff:
   React, FastAPI, WebSockets, SQLAlchemy, and local SQLite.
   [FACT article-2-end-to-end]
2. Explain the deployment path in one short overview: one image, Postgres,
   Compose, integration tests, AWS, and CI/CD.
   [INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end,full-stack-workshop-deployment]
3. Start the technical walkthrough with containerization. Package frontend and
   backend in one multi-stage image. Preserve the existing
   prompt where possible, but make the validation specific: `npm run build`
   produces `dist/client`, FastAPI serves those files, `/docs` works, and the
   WebSocket path works through port 8000. [FACT interview-canvas-repository]
4. Run the image first with SQLite and a named `/data` volume. Use
   `SDIP_DATABASE_URL`, `interview-canvas`, and `interview-canvas-data` in all
   examples. [FACT interview-canvas-repository]
5. Add a Postgres driver and use `postgresql+psycopg://...`. Explain that the
   SQLAlchemy boundary from Article 2 makes this a small application change, but
   still requires tests. [INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end,full-stack-workshop-deployment]
6. Add `compose.yaml` with `app` and `postgres`, a named Postgres volume, a
   database health check, `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`, and service
   name `postgres` in the database URL. [FACT full-stack-workshop-deployment]
7. Add full-flow integration tests against the containerized stack. Cover the
   application's defining behavior: an interviewer creates a session, a
   candidate joins in another client, a canvas change crosses the WebSocket
   room, and persisted state survives an app restart. Include the
   deliberate-break test: remove or bypass an important behavior and verify the
   suite fails. [INFERENCE interview-canvas-repository]
8. Present AWS as the demonstrated path, with a short managed-host detour. The
   live proof of concept uses CloudFormation, one EC2 instance, Docker Compose,
   Postgres on the instance volume, and HTTPS through Caddy or CloudFront.
   Recommend RDS and backups when the data matters. Do not include time-sensitive
   cost estimates. [FACT article-3-live-workshop,interview-canvas-repository]
9. Require the reader to test the public URL with two browser sessions, not just
    trust a successful stack deployment. Verify signup, joining, realtime canvas
    changes, persistence, health checks, and logs. [INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end]
10. Add a GitHub Actions pipeline: frontend and backend tests in parallel,
    integration and end-to-end tests next, deploy only from `main`, smoke-test
    after deploy, and use GitHub OIDC for AWS. [FACT
    article-3-live-workshop,interview-canvas-repository]
11. Remove the temporary admin access key once OIDC works and show how to delete
    the CloudFormation stack so it stops costing money.
    [FACT full-stack-workshop-deployment]
12. End with the boundary between deployment and operations. The next article
    will cover CI/CD maturity, observability, and responding when a deployed app
    fails. [INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end]

## Prompt and command policy

- Keep Article 2's pattern: a short explanation, a copyable prompt, then the
  concrete checks that prove the result. [HUMAN]
- Show commands readers need to validate the result. Avoid pasting large
  generated CloudFormation or workflow files; the linked workshop holds the
  exhaustive walkthrough. [PROPOSAL]
- Use the repository's exact identifiers: `SDIP_DATABASE_URL`, port 8000,
  `dist/client`, and `make test`. [FACT interview-canvas-repository]
- Later sections describe desired generated artifacts because the current repo
  stops at the Dockerfile. Do not write “the assistant creates” as a verified
  fact when the file is absent; write “ask it to create” and explain what to
  inspect. [FACT interview-canvas-repository]

## Voice and structure

- Match Article 2: direct first-person teaching voice, short paragraphs,
  practical prompts, and candid notes about failed first attempts. [HUMAN]
- Prefer concrete checks over broad claims: open two windows, restart the
  container, inspect logs, run migrations against an empty database, and break a
  test on purpose. [INFERENCE article-2-end-to-end,full-stack-workshop-deployment]
- Keep headings descriptive and sentence case. Avoid marketing language,
  excessive warnings, and a catalog of alternatives. [PROPOSAL]

## Counterarguments and tensions

- A managed platform is faster than AWS for a proof of concept. Acknowledge it,
  but retain AWS because it is the workshop's demonstrated infrastructure-as-code
  path and exposes the moving pieces readers need to understand.
  [FACT full-stack-workshop-deployment; PROPOSAL]
- Running Postgres in Compose is easier than managed Postgres, but it does not
  give production backups or failover. Use Compose locally and managed Postgres
  in the cloud. [FACT full-stack-workshop-deployment]
- A green CI run does not prove the application works. Keep a post-deploy smoke
  test and a manual two-browser check in the narrative. [INFERENCE
  article-2-end-to-end,full-stack-workshop-deployment]

## Approved editorial choices

1. Keep AWS/CloudFormation as the main cloud path, with managed platforms as a
   brief shortcut.
2. Skip database migrations in Article 3. Record them as follow-up work rather
   than expanding the deployment walkthrough.
3. Do not claim a live interview-canvas deployment or link to absent deployment
   files.
4. Keep generated configuration concise and emphasize prompts plus validation
   checks; link readers to the full workshop for every step.
5. Start the technical walkthrough with containerization, followed by Postgres,
   Compose, integration tests, deployment, and CI/CD.
